Requires ~Net 9 and perhaps a bit more!

Place all the card info in a `cards.csv` file setup in the following format;

```csv
filename,category,description,rarity
akebono,Space Rare,A Space piolet traveling through out space,Common
```

filename = name of the card&png
category = Category the card is apart of
description = Describe your card and it will be displayed on the gui of the card for lore purposes.
rarity = How rare is the card going to be?

Afterward, place the contents of this zip file in `mtc/cards/[edition-id]/` than run the script, your edition name should be what your editions subfolders are labeled as.

If you encounter any errors send a dm to `@thincreator3483` on discord.
